# Agent Quick Reference

Project-specific guidance for agents working on Template DotNet Tool - a reference
implementation demonstrating best practices for DEMA Consulting .NET CLI tools.

## Available Specialized Agents

- **requirements** agent - Develops requirements and ensures test coverage linkage
- **technical-writer** agent - Creates accurate documentation following regulatory best practices
- **software-developer** agent - Writes production code and self-validation tests in literate style
- **test-developer** agent - Creates unit and integration tests following AAA pattern
- **code-quality** agent - Enforces linting, static analysis, and security standards
- **code-review** agent - Assists in performing formal file reviews
- **repo-consistency** agent - Ensures downstream repositories remain consistent with template patterns

## Agent Selection Guide

- Fix a bug → call the @software-developer agent with the **request** to fix the bug and the **context** of the
  bug details
- Add a new feature → call the @requirements agent with the **request** to define the feature requirements and the
  **context** of the feature details, then call the @software-developer agent with the **request** to implement the
  feature and the **context** of the requirements, then call the @test-developer agent with the **request** to add
  tests and the **context** of the feature implemented
- Write a test → call the @test-developer agent with the **request** to write the test and the **context** of
  what needs to be tested
- Fix linting or static analysis issues → call the @code-quality agent with the **request** to fix the issues
  and the **context** of the errors encountered
- Update documentation → call the @technical-writer agent with the **request** to update the documentation and
  the **context** of what needs to change
- Add or update requirements → call the @requirements agent with the **request** to add or update requirements
  and the **context** of the feature details
- Ensure test coverage linkage in `requirements.yaml` → call the @requirements agent with the **request** to
  ensure test coverage linkage and the **context** of the current coverage gaps
- Run security scanning or address CodeQL alerts → call the @code-quality agent with the **request** to address
  security scanning or CodeQL alerts and the **context** of the alerts found
- Perform a formal file review → call the @code-review agent with the **request** to perform a formal review and
  the **context** of the review-set name
- Propagate template changes → call the @repo-consistency agent with the **request** to propagate template
  changes and the **context** of the downstream repository

## Tech Stack

- C# (latest), .NET 8.0/9.0/10.0, dotnet CLI, NuGet

## Key Files

- **`requirements.yaml`** - Root requirements file using `includes:` to reference `docs/reqstream/` files
- **`docs/reqstream/`** - Per-software-unit, platform, and OTS requirements YAML files
- **`.editorconfig`** - Code style (file-scoped namespaces, 4-space indent, UTF-8, LF endings)
- **`.cspell.yaml`, `.markdownlint-cli2.yaml`, `.yamllint.yaml`** - Linting configs

### Spell check word list policy

**Never** add a word to the `.cspell.yaml` word list in order to silence a spell-checking failure.
Doing so defeats the purpose of spell-checking and reduces the quality of the repository.

- If cspell flags a word that is **misspelled**, fix the spelling in the source file.
- If cspell flags a word that is a **genuine technical term** (tool name, project identifier, etc.) and is
  spelled correctly, raise a **proposal** (e.g. comment in a pull request) explaining why the word
  should be added. The proposal must be reviewed and approved before the word is added to the list.

## Requirements

- All requirements MUST be linked to tests (prefer `TemplateTool_*` self-validation tests)
- Not all tests need to be linked to requirements (tests may exist for corner cases, design testing, failure-testing, etc.)
- Enforced in CI: `dotnet reqstream --requirements requirements.yaml --tests "test-results/**/*.trx" --enforce`
- When adding features: add requirement + link to test

## Test Source Filters

Test links in `requirements.yaml` can include a source filter prefix to restrict which test results count as
evidence. This is critical for platform and framework requirements - **do not remove these filters**.

- `windows@TestName` - proves the test passed on a Windows platform
- `ubuntu@TestName` - proves the test passed on a Linux (Ubuntu) platform
- `macos@TestName` - proves the test passed on a macOS platform
- `net8.0@TestName` - proves the test passed under the .NET 8 target framework
- `net9.0@TestName` - proves the test passed under the .NET 9 target framework
- `net10.0@TestName` - proves the test passed under the .NET 10 target framework
- `dotnet8.x@TestName` - proves the self-validation test ran on a machine with .NET 8.x runtime
- `dotnet9.x@TestName` - proves the self-validation test ran on a machine with .NET 9.x runtime
- `dotnet10.x@TestName` - proves the self-validation test ran on a machine with .NET 10.x runtime

Without the source filter, a test result from any platform/framework satisfies the requirement. Adding the filter
ensures the CI evidence comes specifically from the required environment.

## Testing

- **Test Naming**: `TemplateTool_MethodUnderTest_Scenario` for self-validation tests
- **Self-Validation**: All tests run via `--validate` flag and can output TRX/JUnit format
- **Test Framework**: Uses DemaConsulting.TestResults library for test result generation

## Code Style

- **XML Docs**: On ALL members (public/internal/private) with spaces after `///` in summaries
- **Errors**: `ArgumentException` for parsing, `InvalidOperationException` for runtime issues
- **Namespace**: File-scoped namespaces only
- **Using Statements**: Top of file only (no nested using declarations except for IDisposable)
- **String Formatting**: Use interpolated strings ($"") for clarity

## Project Structure

- `docs/` - Documentation and compliance artifacts
  - `reqstream/` - Per-software-unit, platform, and OTS requirements YAML files (included by root `requirements.yaml`)
  - Auto-generated reports (requirements, justifications, trace matrix)
- `src/` - Source code files
- `test/` - Test files
- `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD pipeline definitions (`build.yaml`, `build_on_push.yaml`, `release.yaml`)
- Configuration files: `.editorconfig`, `.reviewmark.yaml`, `.cspell.yaml`, `.yamllint.yaml`, etc.

### Key Source Files

- **Context.cs**: Handles command-line argument parsing, logging, and output
- **Program.cs**: Main entry point with version/help/validation routing
- **Validation.cs**: Self-validation tests with TRX/JUnit output support

## Build and Test

```bash
# Build the project
dotnet build --configuration Release

# Run unit tests
dotnet test --configuration Release

# Run self-validation
dotnet run --project src/DemaConsulting.TemplateDotNetTool \
  --configuration Release --framework net10.0 --no-build -- --validate

# Use convenience scripts
./build.sh    # Linux/macOS
build.bat     # Windows
```

## Documentation

- **User Guide**: `docs/guide/guide.md`
- **Requirements**: `requirements.yaml` includes `docs/reqstream/` files → auto-generated docs
- **Build Notes**: Auto-generated via BuildMark
- **Code Quality**: Auto-generated via CodeQL and SonarMark
- **Trace Matrix**: Auto-generated via ReqStream
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Not present - changes are captured in the auto-generated build notes

## Markdown Link Style

- **AI agent markdown files** (`.github/agents/*.agent.md`): Use inline links `[text](url)` so URLs are visible
  in agent context
- **README.md**: Use absolute URLs (shipped in NuGet package)
- **All other markdown files**: Use reference-style links `[text][ref]` with `[ref]: url` at document end

## CI/CD

- **Quality Checks**: Markdown lint, spell check, YAML lint
- **Build**: Multi-platform (Windows/Linux/macOS)
- **CodeQL**: Security scanning
- **Integration Tests**: .NET 8/9/10 on Windows/Linux/macOS
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated via Pandoc + Weasyprint

## Common Tasks

```bash
# Format code
dotnet format

# Run all linters
./lint.sh     # Linux/macOS
lint.bat      # Windows

# Pack as NuGet tool
dotnet pack --configuration Release
```

## Agent Report Files

When agents need to write report files to communicate with each other or the user, follow these guidelines:

- **Naming Convention**: Use the pattern `AGENT_REPORT_xxxx.md` (e.g., `AGENT_REPORT_analysis.md`, `AGENT_REPORT_results.md`)
- **Purpose**: These files are for temporary inter-agent communication and should not be committed
- **Exclusions**: Files matching `AGENT_REPORT_*.md` are automatically:
  - Excluded from git (via .gitignore)
  - Excluded from markdown linting
  - Excluded from spell checking
