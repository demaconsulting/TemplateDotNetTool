# Pandoc Verification

This document provides the verification evidence for the `Pandoc` OTS software item.

## Required Functionality

DemaConsulting.PandocTool converts Markdown source documents to HTML as part of the documentation
build pipeline. FileAssert validates that each generated HTML file exists, has a non-trivial size,
contains a valid HTML title element, and includes expected document content. Passing FileAssert
assertions for each document type proves Pandoc executed correctly and produced meaningful output.

## Verification Approach

Pandoc is verified by self-validation evidence from the CI pipeline. Each scenario is a FileAssert
assertion that runs after Pandoc converts a specific Markdown document to HTML. A passing pipeline
run for all scenarios constitutes evidence that the requirement is satisfied.

## Test Scenarios

### Pandoc_CodeQualityHtml

**Scenario**: FileAssert asserts the code-quality HTML file exists, is non-trivially sized, contains
a valid HTML title element, and includes expected document content.

**Expected**: FileAssert exits 0 for the code-quality HTML document.

**Requirement coverage**: `Template-OTS-Pandoc`.
