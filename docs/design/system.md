# System Design

This document describes the system-level design of the Template DotNet Tool,
including the overall architecture, external interfaces, and system-wide design
decisions that affect all subsystems.

## System Architecture

The Template DotNet Tool is a command-line application built on the .NET
platform that demonstrates DEMA Consulting best practices for .NET tool
development. The system consists of three primary subsystems working together
to provide a robust, testable, and maintainable command-line tool:

### Major Components

- **CLI Subsystem** — Command-line argument parsing and user interface
  management, providing standardized input processing and output formatting
- **SelfTest Subsystem** — Automated validation framework enabling the tool to
  verify its own functionality and report test results
- **Utilities Subsystem** — Shared utility functions providing common
  functionality across all subsystems

### Component Interactions

The Program unit acts as the system orchestrator, coordinating interactions
between subsystems:

1. **Initialization Phase** — Program creates Context from CLI subsystem to
   parse command-line arguments and configure system behavior
2. **Execution Phase** — Program delegates to appropriate subsystem based on
   parsed arguments (help display, version query, self-validation, or main tool
   logic)
3. **Output Phase** — All subsystems use Context for consistent output
   formatting and logging

## External Interfaces

### Command-Line Interface

The system accepts command-line arguments following standard conventions:

- **Version Query**: `-v`, `--version` — Display version information
- **Help Display**: `-?`, `-h`, `--help` — Show usage information
- **Silent Mode**: `--silent` — Suppress console output
- **Self-Validation**: `--validate` — Run internal test suite
- **Results Output**: `--results <file>` — Write test results to TRX or XML file
- **Logging**: `--log <file>` — Write all output to log file

### File System Interface

The system interacts with the file system for:

- **Log File Output** — Optional logging to user-specified file path
- **Test Results Output** — Optional test results in TRX or JUnit XML format for CI/CD integration
- **Path Operations** — Safe path combination and validation through Utilities subsystem

### Standard I/O Interface

The system uses standard console I/O streams:

- **Standard Output** — Normal program output and information display
- **Standard Error** — Error messages and exception information  
- **Color Output** — Red color coding for error messages when supported

## Data Flow

### Input Processing Flow

1. **Command-line arguments** → CLI subsystem parses into Context object
2. **Context object** → Program uses to determine execution path
3. **User input validation** → Context throws typed exceptions for invalid arguments

### Output Processing Flow

1. **Program logic** → Generates output messages and status information
2. **Context formatting** → Applies consistent formatting and color coding
3. **Multi-target output** → Simultaneously writes to console and log file (if enabled)

### Error Handling Flow

1. **Exception generation** → Units throw typed exceptions with context information
2. **Exception catching** → Program catches and categorizes exceptions
3. **Error reporting** → Context formats and displays appropriate error messages
4. **Exit code setting** → Program returns appropriate exit codes for automation

## System-Wide Design Constraints

### .NET Runtime Requirements

The system targets multiple .NET runtime versions to maximize compatibility:

- **.NET 8.0** — Long-term support baseline
- **.NET 9.0** — Current standard runtime
- **.NET 10.0** — Latest runtime for forward compatibility

### Dependency Injection Architecture

All subsystems follow dependency injection patterns:

- **Constructor injection** — All external dependencies injected via constructors
- **Interface abstraction** — Dependencies defined through interfaces where appropriate
- **Testability focus** — Design enables comprehensive unit testing with mocked dependencies

### Error Handling Strategy

System-wide error handling follows consistent patterns:

- **Typed exceptions** — Use specific exception types (ArgumentException, InvalidOperationException)
- **Context preservation** — Exception messages include sufficient troubleshooting information
- **Audit logging** — When logging is enabled (for example, via `--log`), all errors are logged for
  compliance and debugging purposes

### Thread Safety

The system operates as a single-threaded console application:

- **No shared state** — Units avoid static mutable state
- **Immutable design** — Configuration objects use init-only properties
- **Resource cleanup** — IDisposable pattern for file handles and resources

## Integration Patterns

### Test Integration

The system integrates with external testing infrastructure:

- **TRX output format** — Compatible with MSTest and ReqStream requirements traceability
- **Exit code conventions** — Returns 0 for success, non-zero for failures
- **Structured logging** — Consistent output format for automated processing

### CI/CD Integration

The system supports automated build and deployment:

- **Multi-framework compilation** — Single codebase targets multiple .NET versions
- **Self-validation capability** — Built-in testing for deployment verification
- **Logging integration** — File-based logging for automated analysis

### Requirements Traceability

The system design supports compliance and audit requirements:

- **ReqStream integration** — Test output format compatible with requirements management
- **Documentation generation** — Design documents provide implementation traceability
- **Review evidence** — Structured design enables formal code review processes

## Performance Characteristics

### Startup Performance

The system prioritizes fast startup for command-line usage:

- **Minimal initialization** — Only essential components loaded at startup
- **Lazy evaluation** — Resource-intensive operations deferred until needed
- **Efficient argument parsing** — Linear-time parsing with early validation

### Memory Usage

The system maintains low memory footprint:

- **Streaming I/O** — File operations use streaming for large outputs
- **Bounded allocation** — No unbounded collection growth
- **Prompt disposal** — Resources released immediately after use

### Scalability Constraints

As a command-line tool, the system has defined scalability boundaries:

- **Single-user operation** — Designed for individual command execution
- **Stateless execution** — No persistent state between invocations
- **Process isolation** — Each invocation runs in separate process

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation

All external inputs receive validation:

- **Argument validation** — Command-line arguments checked for validity and safety
- **Path validation** — File paths validated to prevent directory traversal
- **Exception handling** — Input errors reported without exposing system internals

### File System Access

File system operations follow security best practices:

- **Controlled access** — Only user-specified paths accessed
- **Permission handling** — Graceful degradation for insufficient permissions
- **Path sanitization** — All file paths validated and sanitized

### Information Disclosure

The system prevents unintended information disclosure:

- **Error message filtering** — Exception details limited to necessary information
- **Log content control** — Sensitive information excluded from log files
- **Version information** — Only public version information exposed
