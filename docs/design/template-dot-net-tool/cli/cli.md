# Cli Subsystem

The `Cli` subsystem provides the command-line interface for the Template DotNet Tool.
It is responsible for accepting user input from the command line and routing output to
the console and an optional log file.

## Overview

The `Cli` subsystem acts as the primary boundary between the user's shell invocation and
the tool's internal logic. It owns argument parsing, output formatting, and error tracking.
All other subsystems receive a `Context` object from the `Cli` subsystem to read parsed
flags and write output.

## Units

The `Cli` subsystem contains the following software unit:

| Unit      | File             | Responsibility                                    |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `Context` | `Cli/Context.cs` | Argument parsing, output channels, and exit code. |

## Interfaces

The `Cli` subsystem exposes the following interface to the rest of the tool:

| Interface              | Direction | Description                                                                           |
|------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Context.Create`       | Outbound  | Factory method constructing a `Context` from `string[] args`. `--result` is accepted as a legacy alias for `--results`. |
| `Context.WriteLine`    | Outbound  | Writes a message to console and optional log file.                                    |
| `Context.WriteError`   | Outbound  | Writes an error to stderr and sets the error exit code.                               |
| `Context.ExitCode`     | Outbound  | Returns 0 for success or 1 when errors have been reported.                            |
| `Context.HeadingDepth` | Outbound  | Heading depth for markdown output (default 1); supplied via `--depth`.                |
| `Context.Version`      | Outbound  | `true` when `-v` or `--version` was passed.                                           |
| `Context.Help`         | Outbound  | `true` when `-?`, `-h`, or `--help` was passed.                                       |
| `Context.Silent`       | Outbound  | `true` when `--silent` was passed.                                                    |
| `Context.Validate`     | Outbound  | `true` when `--validate` was passed.                                                  |
| `Context.ResultsFile`  | Outbound  | Path supplied after `--results` or `--result`, or `null`.                             |

## Interactions

The `Cli` subsystem has no dependencies on other tool subsystems. It uses only .NET base
class library types. The `Program` unit at system level creates the `Context` and passes it
to all subsystems that need to produce output.

Subsystem verification uses `Program.Run` as an observable entry point alongside `Context.Create`.
This is intentional: the subsystem boundary is defined as the pair `(Context.Create, Program.Run)`,
and subsystem tests exercise both together to confirm end-to-end argument-to-behavior flow.
